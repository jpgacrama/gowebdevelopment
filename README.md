## Setting Up Your Environment

### Initializing a Go Module

To ensure proper module support for your Go project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project's root directory using the terminal.
2. Run the following command to initialize a Go module:

    ```bash
    go mod init your-module-name
    ```

   Replace "your-module-name" with a suitable module name for your project.

### Fixing Workspace Errors in VSCode

If you encounter workspace errors related to gopls while using VSCode, follow these steps:

1. Open the workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`).
2. Ensure that the "gopls" configuration is present:

    ```json
    {
      "gopls": {
        "usePlaceholders": true,
        "experimentalWorkspaceModule": true
      }
    }
    ```

3. Restart VSCode after making these changes.

For more details on setting up your workspace with gopls, refer to the [gopls Workspace Setup documentation](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/workspace.md).

Feel free to explore the examples and source codes for a hands-on experience in Go Web Development with Angular! I use VSCode as my editor of choice for this project.
